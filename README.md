# valdb

**This is an experimental project.**

`valdb` is a proof-of-concept for an addon/plugin for the `@wxn0brp/db` (ValtheraDB) library.

The purpose of this experiment is to create a storage layer that allows ValtheraDB, which normally operates on a directory/file structure, to instead use a single binary file for data storage.

The code in this repository is not actively maintained and should be considered a work in progress. It was created as an experiment and may be continued in the future.
